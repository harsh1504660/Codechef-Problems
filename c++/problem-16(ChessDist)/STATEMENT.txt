Problem
The Chessboard Distance for any two points 
(

1
,
�
1
)
(X 
1
​
 ,Y 
1
​
 ) and 
(
�
2

​
 ,Y 
2
​
 ) on a Cartesian plane is defined as 
�

You are given two points 
(
�
1
,
�
1
)
(X 
1
​
 ,Y 
1
​
 ) and 
(
�
2
,
�
2
)
(X 
2
​
 ,Y 
2
​
 ). Output their Chessboard Distance.

Note that, 
∣
�
∣
∣P∣ denotes the absolute value of integer 
�
P. For example, 
∣
−
4
∣
=
4
∣−4∣=4 and 
∣
7
∣
=
7
∣7∣=7.

Input Format
First line will contain 
�
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing 
4
4 space separated integers -
