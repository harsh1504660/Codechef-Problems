No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was

1

​
  kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after 
�
M months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was 
�
2
w 
2
​
  kg (

 ).

Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between 
�
1
x 
1
​
  and 
�
2
x 
2
​
  kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Chef assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
�
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers

 ,

M.
Output
